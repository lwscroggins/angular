	<div>I'm not sure what's going to to here. At the moment this whole website is a hodge-podge of stuff.</div>
	<div>I have the following ideas:
		<ul>
			<li>Stuff about my Star Wars loves</li>
			<li>Stuff about my Star Trek love</li>
			<li>My obsession with Harry Potter fanfiction</li>
			<li>A redo of the Binary Tree tutorial I worked on for my final Code Fellows project</li>
			<li>A sudoku solver</li>
		</ul>
