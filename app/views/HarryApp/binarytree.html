<div data-ng-controller="treecontroller">Binary Tree Tutorial</div>
<div>This is where the Binary Tree tutorial will go. I need the following:
	<ul>
		<li>d3.js installed and running</li>
		<li>some knowledge about the BST</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	When finished, the user should be able to add and remove nodes and there should be some animation to show
	what is going on with the nodes.
